<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cable Locators & Pipe Locators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Location</li><li>Passive Location</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cable locators and pipe locators are essential tools for locating underground utilities. The market is divided into two main types: active and passive location. Active location involves sending a signal through the utility line and using a receiver to detect the signal's presence, allowing for accurate tracing. In contrast, passive location relies on detecting existing electromagnetic fields generated by the utilities without adding any external signal. Both methods ensure safe excavation, preventing damage and promoting efficient construction and maintenance activities.</p></p>
