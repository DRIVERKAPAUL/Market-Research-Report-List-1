<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilator for Critical Care Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The critical care ventilator market is primarily divided into two types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators involve the use of an artificial airway, such as endotracheal tubes, delivering air directly into the lungs, typically required for patients with severe respiratory distress. In contrast, non-invasive ventilators use masks or similar devices to assist breathing without invasive procedures, making them suitable for conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or acute respiratory failure, where less aggressive intervention is sufficient.</p></p>
