<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Machine Tool Probe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Probe</li><li>Non-Contact Probe</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The machine tool probe market is segmented into two main types: contact probes and non-contact probes. Contact probes physically touch the workpiece to gather precise measurements, making them ideal for applications requiring high accuracy and surface inspection. Non-contact probes, on the other hand, use technologies such as lasers or infrared sensors to measure without physical contact, allowing for faster assessments and minimizing the risk of damage to delicate parts. Both types are essential for enhancing manufacturing precision and efficiency.</p></p>
